This is my first post `is this hyperlink`

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name)
  return 'Hi {}'.format(name)

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
